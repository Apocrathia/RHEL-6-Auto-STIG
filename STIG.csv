V-38437,SV-50237r1_rule,RHEL-06-000526,Automated file system mounting tools must not be enabled unless needed.,"All filesystems that are required for the successful operation of the system should be explicitly listed in '/etc/fstab' by an administrator. New filesystems should not be arbitrarily introduced via the automounter.The 'autofs' daemon mounts and unmounts filesystems, such as user home directories shared via NFS, on demand. In addition, autofs can be used to handle removable media, and the default configuration provides the cdrom device as '/misc/cd'. However, this method of providing access to removable media is not common, so autofs can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even if NFS is required, it is almost always possible to configure filesystem mounts statically by editing '/etc/fstab' rather than relying on the automounter. ","To verify the 'autofs' service is disabled, run the following command: chkconfig --list autofsIf properly configured, the output should be the following: autofs 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:offVerify the 'autofs' service is not running:# service autofs statusIf the autofs service is enabled or running, this is a finding.","If the 'autofs' service is not needed to dynamically mount NFS filesystems or removable media, disable the service for all runlevels: # chkconfig --level 0123456 autofs offStop the service if it is already running: # service autofs stop"

Periodically running AIDE may reveal unexpected changes in installed files.","To determine that periodic AIDE execution has been scheduled, run the following command: # grep aide /etc/crontabIf there is no output, this is a finding.","AIDE should be executed on a periodic basis to check for changes. To implement a daily execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to /etc/crontab: 05 4 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide --checkAIDE can be executed periodically through other means; this is merely one example."
V-38701,SV-50502r1_rule,RHEL-06-000338,The TFTP daemon must operate in secure mode which provides access only to a single directory on the host file system.,Using the '-s' option causes the TFTP service to only serve files from the given directory. Serving files from an intentionally specified directory reduces the risk of sharing files which should remain private.,"Verify 'tftp' is configured by with the '-s' option by running the following command: grep 'server_args' /etc/xinetd.d/tftpThe output should indicate the 'server_args' variable is configured with the '-s' flag, matching the example below:# grep 'server_args' /etc/xinetd.d/tftpserver_args = -s /var/lib/tftpbootIf it does not, this is a finding.","If running the 'tftp' service is necessary, it should be configured to change its root directory at startup. To do so, ensure '/etc/xinetd.d/tftp' includes '-s' as a command line argument, as shown in the following example (which is also the default): server_args = -s /var/lib/tftpboot"
V-38702,SV-50503r1_rule,RHEL-06-000339,The FTP daemon must be configured for logging or verbose mode.,"To trace malicious activity facilitated by the FTP service, it must be configured to ensure that all commands sent to the ftp server are logged using the verbose vsftpd log format. The default vsftpd log file is /var/log/vsftpd.log.","Find if logging is applied to the ftp daemon. Procedures: If vsftpd is started by xinetd the following command will indicate the xinetd.d startup file. # grep vsftpd /etc/xinetd.d/*# grep server_args [vsftpd xinetd.d startup file]This will indicate the vsftpd config file used when starting through xinetd. If the [server_args]line is missing or does not include the vsftpd configuration file, then the default config file (/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf) is used. # grep xferlog_enable [vsftpd config file]If xferlog_enable is missing, or is not set to yes, this is a finding.","Add or correct the following configuration options within the 'vsftpd' configuration file, located at '/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf'. xferlog_enable=YESxferlog_std_format=NOlog_ftp_protocol=YES"
